History of programming languages
1843: Ada Lovelace’s machine algorithm
Ada Lovelace invents the first-ever machine algorithm for Charles Babbage’s Difference Machine that lays the foundation for all programming languages.

1944-45: Plankalkül
onrad Zuse developed the first ‘real’ programming language called Plankalkül (Plan Calculus). could be invoked over and over to perform routine operations.

1949: Assembly Language
low-level programming language. The specific instructions necessary to operate a computer.

1949: Shortcode
Shortcode (or Short-order code), was the first High-Level Language (HLL) suggested by John McCauley in 1949. William Schmitt who implemented it for the BINAC computer the same year and for the UNIVAC in 1950.

1952: Autocode
First developed by Alick Glennie for the Mark 1 computer at the University of Manchester. it can be translated directly into machine code using a program called a compiler. 

1957: FORTRAN
FORmula TRANslation or FORTRAN was created by John Backus and is considered to be the oldest programming language in use today. high-level scientific, mathematical, and statistical computations.

1958: ALGOL (Algorithmic Language)
created by a joint committee of American and European computer scientists. ALGOL served as the starting point for the development of some of the most important programming languages including Pascal, C, C++, and Java.

1958: LISP (List Processor)
invented by John McCarthy at the Massachusetts Institue of Technology (MIT). Originally purposed for artificial intelligence, LISP is one of the oldest programming languages still in use today and can be used in the place of Ruby or Python. Companies such as Acceleration, Boeing, and Genworks are still using LISP in their tech stacks.
1959: COBOL (Common Business Oriented Language)
Common Business Oriented Language (COBOL), is the programming language behind many credit card processors, ATMs, telephone and cell calls, hospital signals, and traffic signals systems (just to name a few). The development of the language was led by Dr. Grace Murray Hopper and was designed so that it could run on all brands and types of computers. COBOL is still used to this day primarily for banking and gamification systems.

1964: BASIC (Beginner’s All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code)
Beginners All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code or BASIC was developed by a group of students at Dartmouth College. The language was written for students who did not have a strong understanding of mathematics or computers. The language was  developed further by Microsoft founders Bill Gates and Paul Allen and became the first marketable product of the company.

1970: PASCAL
Named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal, Niklaus Wirth developed the programming language in his honor. It was developed as a learning tool for computer programming which meant it was easy to learn. It was favored by Apple in the company’s early days,  because of its ease of use and power.

1972: Smalltalk
Developed by Alan Kay, Adele Goldberg, and Dan Ingalls, Smalltalk allowed for computer programmers to modify code on the fly. It introduced a variety of programming language aspects that are visible languages of today such as Python, Java, and Ruby. Companies such as Leafly, Logitech, and CrowdStrike state they use Smalltalk in their tech stacks.


1972: C
Developed by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Telephone Laboratories for use with the Unix operating system. It was called C because it was based on an earlier language called ‘B’. Many of the current leading languages are derivatives of C including; C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, PHP, and Python. It also has been/still being used by huge companies like Google, Facebook, and Apple.

1972: SQL (SEQUEL at the time)
Structured Query Language is first developed by IBM researchers Raymond Boyce and Donald Chamberlain. It is used for viewing and changing information that is stored in databases. There are a plethora of companies that use SQL and some of them include Microsoft and Accenture.
1980/81: Ada
Ada was originally designed by a team led by Jean Ichbiah of CUU Honeywell object-oriented high-level programming language. Ada was extended from other popular programming languages at the time such as Pascal. Ada is used for air-traffic management systems in countries such as Australia, Belgium, and Germany as well as a host of other transport and space projects.

1983: C++
Bjarne Stroustrup modified the C language at the Bell Labs, C++ is an extension of C with enhancements such as classes, virtual functions, and templates.it is used in MS Office, Adobe Photoshop, game engines, and other high-performance software.

Objective-C
Developed by Brad Cox and Tom Love, Objective-C is the main programming language used to write software for macOS and iOS, Apple’s operating systems.
1987: Perl
created by Larry Wall and is a general-purpose, high-level programming language. It was originally designed as a scripting language designed for text editing but nowadays it’s widely used for many purposes such as CGI, database applications, system administration, network programming, and graphic programming.
1990: Haskell
Haskell is a general-purpose programming language named after the American logician and mathematician Haskell Brooks Curry. It is a purely functional programming language meaning it’s primarily mathematical. It’s used across multiple industries particularly those that deal with complicated calculations, records, and number-crunching. Like many other programming languages from this era, it is not overly common to see Haskell in use for well-known applications. With that said, the programming language has been used to write a number of games one of which is Nikki and the Robots.

1991: Python
Named after the British comedy troupe ‘Monty Python’, Python was developed by Guido Van Rossum. It is a general-purpose, high-level programming language created to support a variety of programming styles used by companies such as Google, yahoo, and Spotify.
1991: Visual Basic
Developed by Microsoft, Visual Basic allows programmers to utilize a drag-and-drop style of choosing and changing pre-selected chunks of code through a graphical user interface (GUI). The language is not overly used these days however Microsoft has used portions Visual Basic to a number of their applications like Word, Excel, and Access.

1993: Ruby
Created by Yukihiro Matsumoto, Ruby is an interpreted high-level programming language. A teaching language which was influenced by Perl, Ada, Lisp, and Smalltalk – among others. Ruby’s primary uses are for web applications development and Ruby on Rails. Twitter, Hulu, and Groupon are some well-known examples of companies that use Ruby.

1995: Java
Java is a general-purpose, high-level language created by James Gosling for an interactive TV project. Java can be found everywhere, from computers to smartphones to parking meters.

1995: PHP
Formerly known as ‘Personal Home Page’ which now stands for ‘Hypertext Preprocessor’, PHP was developed by Rasmus Lerdorf. Its primary uses include building and maintaining dynamic web pages, as well as server-side development. Some of the biggest companies from across the globe use PHP including Facebook, Wikipedia, Digg, WordPress, and Joomla.

1995: JavaScript
JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich, this language is primarily used for dynamic web development, PDF documents, web browsers, and desktop widgets. Almost every major website uses JavaScript. Gmail, Adobe Photoshop, and Mozilla Firefox include some well-known examples.

2000: C#
Developed at Microsoft with the hope of combining the computing ability of C++ with the simplicity of Visual Basic, C# is based on C++ and shares many similarities with Java. The language is used in almost all Microsoft products and is seen primarily in developing desktop applications.

2003: Scala
Developed by Martin Odersky, Scala which combines mathematical functional programming and organized object-oriented programming. Scala’s compatibility with Java makes it helpful with Android development. Linkedin, Twitter, Foursquare, and Netflix are just a few examples of the many companies that use Scala in their tech stacks.
2003: Groovy
Derived from Java, Groovy was developed by James Strachan and Bob McWhirter. The language improves productivity because of its succinct and easy to learn. Some well-known companies that are using Groovy in their tech stacks are Starbucks, Transferwise, and Craftbase.

2009: Go
Go was developed by Google to address issues that occur due to large software systems. Due to its simple and modern structure, Go has gained popularity among some of the largest tech companies around the world such as Google, Uber, Twitch, and Dropbox.

2014: Swift
Developed by Apple as a replacement for C, C++, and Objective-C, Swift was developed with the intention to be easier than the aforementioned languages and allow less room for error. Swift’s versatility means it can be used for desktop, mobile, and cloud applications. Leading language app ‘Duolingo’ launched a new app that was written in Swift.
